	# Removal is not quite the opposite of installation; we leave the
	# non-delphix services alone, even if the postinst script changed
	# the state of these services. This is because we don't know what
	# the state of these services was before the postinst script ran,
	# so we can't reliably restore the system back to that prior state.

	systemctl disable delphix.target
	systemctl disable delphix-platform.service

	#
	# We also need to remove the "ansible-done" file, to ensure that
	# package removal will remove the "/var/lib/delphix-platform"
	# directory. Since the "ansible-done" file isn't "owned' by the
	# package, if it exists, it'll cause the package manager to
	# leave the file and directory lingering on the filesystem on
	# uninstallation; the package removal will succeed, but the
	# directory won't be removed.
	#
	# Also note, this command needs to stay in sync with the command
	# that's executed when "systemctl reload delphix-platform" is
	# called. See the "delphix-platform.service" file for details.

	rm -f /var/lib/delphix-platform/ansible-done
