	# We need to make sure that the motd-news.service is disabled. This
	# service reaches out to a public Ubuntu news service over the public
	# Internet to cache dynamic content that is then optionally printed by
	# /etc/update-motd.d/50-motd-news. There are at least three problems
	# with this:
	#
	# 1. We don't want engines in customer environments reaching out to
	#    public services.
	# 2. We don't care about the dynamic content provided by Ubuntu.
	# 3. The service explicitly runs the /etc/update-motd.d/50-motd-news
	#    script and fails if that script isn't executable, and we
	#    turn off all executable bits on files in this directory except
	#    those supplied by Delphix to suppress non-Delphix motd messages.
	#
	# As such, the service needs to be disable, which involves both the
	# service unit along with the timer unit that is tasked with running it
	# every 12 hours.
