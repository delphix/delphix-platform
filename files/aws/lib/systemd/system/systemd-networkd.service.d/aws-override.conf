# Changing instance type on AWS could result in the instance booting with an invalid network configuration. See
# DLPX-85209 for more context. This is being handled by switching to MAC based interface names only on AWS from
# 6.0.17.0.
# The fix requires special handling for upgrade scenario. To preserve the network interfaces post reboot into the
# new images, during upgrade workflow on the old image, we create a map file containing a map from existing network
# interface names as keys and their mac address as the value. The map is then referred to by the
# update_netplan_to_mac_address script post reboot to update the network interfaces in the netplan file to their
# corresponding mac address based names. Since this renaming needs to happen before the systemd-networkd executes
# executes its main logic, we run the update_netplan_to_mac_address script as part of PreExecStart directive.
