# 1. This script is applicable only for Upgrade scenarios in AWS deployments
# 2. The fix for DLPX-75209 shifts to use mac addresses instead of canonical network
# interface names. To handle this change for upgrades, we save a map from interface
# names to their mac addresses. Post reboot, this script will be called as part of
# the PreExecStart directive in systemd-networkd service.
# 3. The script takes the map and matches the keys with the existing interface names
# in the netplan file, and for each such match, replaces the interface name with the
# corresponding mac address stored in the map file

# We want to process the map file only when we reboot into the new version post upgrade, and not during
# any other scenario where the systemd-networkd service could get restarted. This requires us to check
# for the following conditions which are valid only after having booted into the new version post upgrade.
# 1. Existence of the map file, which is generated during the upgrade processing.
# 2. Existence of mac address based network interface filenames under the /sys/class/net heirarchy.
# 3. Non-existence of the mac address based network interface names in the local netplan file.
