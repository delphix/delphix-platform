# Enable forwarding of journald logs to the syslog service
# This helps to ensure compatibility with legacy log systems
# that rely on syslog for centralized log collection.

ForwardToSyslog=yes
#
# Enable compression for journald logs to save disk space.
# Older log files will be compressed automatically, helping to
# retain logs longer without using excessive storage.
#
Compress=yes
#
# Configure journald to persistently keep logs, so that we can inspect
# them after a reboot has already occurred. This helps debugging, and
# also can make the collection of support bundles more useful.

# The platform service will burst a few thousand lines into the logs
# when it runs on first boot, and then generally not emit any lines
# after that. To ensure that service's logs do not get truncated, we
# have to tune the rate limiter to accomadate this; the default is 1K.

RateLimitBurst=5000
