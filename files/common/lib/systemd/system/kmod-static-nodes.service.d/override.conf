#
# During upgrade verification, the root filesystem will be booted as a
# container using systemd-nspawn, and /dev/zfs will be bind mounted into
# that container. The "kmod-static-nodes" will run in the container by
# default, and this service will attempt to change the permissions of
# "/dev/zfs" (because of what "kmod static-nodes" reports). To avoid
# this errant "chmod", we disable the "kmod-static-nodes" from running
# within the container.
