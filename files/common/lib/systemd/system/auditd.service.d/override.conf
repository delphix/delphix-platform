# During upgrade verification, the root filesystem will be booted as a
# container using systemd-nspawn. When the auditd service runs in this
# container, it can fail and cause the upgrade to fail as a result.
# Thus, to workaround this problem, we explicitly disable this service
# from running when inside of the container.
