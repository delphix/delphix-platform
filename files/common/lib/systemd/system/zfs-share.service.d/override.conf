#
# During upgrade verification, the root filesystem will be booted as a
# container using systemd-nspawn. We don't "sandbox" the container, so
# when zfs-share.service runs, it'll automatically mount all "domain0"
# mountpoints (or "dcenter" mountpoints for our DCenter systems). These
# mounts in the container can then impact software running outside of
# the container; e.g. "zfs destroy" can fail with EBUSY.
#
# Thus, to workaround this problem, we explicitly disable this service
# from running when inside of the container.
