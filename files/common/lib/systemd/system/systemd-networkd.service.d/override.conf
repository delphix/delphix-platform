# We use "netplan apply" to make network changes which causes
# a restart of the systemd-networkd service. Since we can
# have any number of network configuration changes, we may exceed
# the service's default restart limit causing the service to
# fail. To avoid this we set the value high enough to be able
# pass our unit tests.

# We raise the log level to help diagnose problems. In the event that
# networking fails, this additional information is valuable.
