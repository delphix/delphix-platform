# By default, systemd creates multiple .device units for each block device on
# the system: one for the device file in /dev/, one for sysfs representation of
# the device, and one for each of the udev-created symlinks to the device. If
# the device is partitioned, each of these units is also created for each of the
# partitions. For us, creating a zvol typically triggers the creation of 12
# .device units. On larger engines, we can easily hit systemd's hard limit of
# 128K units on a system, at which point systemd stops functioning.
#
# We can work around this by preventing udev from notifying systemd about the
# existence of zvols, so that systemd doesn't generate .device units for them.
# We don't use these auto-generated units anyway.
