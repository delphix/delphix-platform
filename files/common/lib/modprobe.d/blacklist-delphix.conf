# ADDED BY DELPHIX

# The floppy driver is buggy in the 5.0.0 kernel and sometimes causes the
# system to hang at boot time or later. We do not use floppy devices in Linux
# but systems that migrated from Illumos may have a floppy device present.
# See DLPX-67583 for more info.

blacklist floppy
install floppy /bin/false

#
# The balloon driver will negatively impact the performance of the delphix engine.
# To prevent this impact we disable it and prevent it from loading.

blacklist vmw_balloon
install vmw_balloon /bin/false
