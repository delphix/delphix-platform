# This is a bit awkward, but we've hardcoded the device we're using for
# swap here, based on the assumption that the Delphix buildserver will
# only be used on AWS, and will have 3 "data" disks available like
# normal internal Delphix DCenter systems.
#
# Additionally, we're not using a file on the root filesystem, as we
# assume the root filesystem is on ZFS, and swap on ZFS can lead to
# deadlocks; see: https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/7734.
