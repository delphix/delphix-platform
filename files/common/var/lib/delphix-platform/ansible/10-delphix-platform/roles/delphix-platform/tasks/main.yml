# We want the ssh service to start as early as possible during boot up,
# so we explicitly remove all dependencies of the service here. We've
# configured the service not to use the "default" dependencies, via the
# "override.conf" file in the delphix-platform package. Unfortuantely
# though, we can't remove any dependencies specified using "After=" in
# the original SSH service file, by using that same "override.conf"
# file. Thus, to remove the "After=" dependencies, we have to create a
# completely new unit definition for the SSH service, that will override
# the original unit definition; Systemd allows us to use files in
# "/etc/systemd" to replace files in "/lib/systemd".
#
# So, the strategy here is to copy the original unit definition from
# "/lib/systemd" (the file is provided by the SSH package) to
# "/etc/systemd", and then modify the copy to remove the "After=" line.
# This way, if the original unit definitation is changed on upgrade,
# we'll automatically use the new file from the new package; but we'll
# still be able to modify the file to remove the "After=" dependencies.
# Additionally, we don't modify the file in "/lib/systemd" directly, so
# that we don't break "debsums -c", and it's easy to "revert" our
# changes by simply removing our copy in "/etc/systemd".
