The /var/target/pr directory is used by the LinuxIO (LIO) framework to
store persistent reservation data. If this directory is not present then
SCSI-3 reservations will not work on iSCSI LUNs exposed by LIO, which are
required by Windows Server Failover Cluster.

Do not delete this README from source as this will remove the /var/target/pr
directory from git.
