# We use this to ensure the logs created during upgrade are cleaned up,
# such that they don't consume too much space on the root filesystem.
# Using 7 days as the limit for how long we keeps logs, vs some other
# number of days, is sort of an arbitrary decision; ultimately, we just
# need to keep logs for a long enough time, so that they're still
# available when they're needed (e.g. to root cause an upgrade failure),
# and removed before they consume storage space to the point of causing
# capacity problems on the root filesystem and/or root pool.

# After the old files have been deleted, we need to remove any empty
