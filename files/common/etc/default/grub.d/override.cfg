# Increase the amount of memory reserved for the crash kernel.
#
# Empirically, it seems we need about 512M to get it to boot so
# supplying something like "crashkernel=512M" in the cmdline
# provided by GRUB to the OS would suffice.
#
# Unfortunately, given our current kernel (v4.15 at the time of this
# writing) the system would try to allocate a contiguous chunk out
# of low memory (the first 896MBs of it to be specific). This works
# well most of the time except from the cases when KASLR places the
# running kernel in that region making it impossible for the system
# to find a contiguous 512MB chunk for the crash kernel.
#
# This behavior has been fixed in newer versions of the kernel but
# as we are stuck in the current version for now we are left with
# the following workaround: We split the 512M allocation to two
# chunks, one within the 896MB window of low memory and one in high
# memory. Using high memory for the whole reservation would be ideal
# but certain types of allocations from the crash kernel can only
# happen in low memory. As a result we are forced to split this
# chunk to a low memory and a high memory part.
#
# The tradeoff in sizing the low memory segment is the following:
# - The smaller the low memory segment, the higher the probability
#   of it finding a free contiguous block for its size in the first
#   896MB of memory and thus the probability that the crash kernel
#   will be loaded. This also allows more memory to be used in
#   userspace allocations in the crash kernel.
# - The bigger the low memory segment, the smaller the chances of
#   the crash kernel running out of kernel memory and becoming
#   unresponsive.
#
# In both extreme scenarios the worst-case is the same. The system
# becomes unresponsive either because it panicked and there was no
# crash kernel to load, or because the crash kernel did load but
# got stuck as it ran out of memory. Splitting the 512MB segment
# in the middle (256MB for each chunk) empirically seems to not
# cause any problems.
#
# Side Note:
# We have a testing/debugging use case in appliance-build where we
# load up an image on QEMU using 1GB of RAM or less. For this use
# case the system will boot normally but the crash kernel will fail
# to load, so generating crash dumps on panic is not expected to
# work for such systems.
