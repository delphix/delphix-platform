# Override the nfs-mountd service execution parameters. By default, the
# service provides the --manage-gids flag so NFS will be aware of group
# membership for users in more than 16 groups. However, this flag has
# the undesirable side-effect of preventing users from accessing files
# owned by a group they are a member of, unless it's their primary
# group. As we do not have a great deal of control of our users' groups
# configuration, we have decided to disable the feature. Since Illumos
# users were already limited to 16 groups for NFS, this is not a change
# in behavior.
